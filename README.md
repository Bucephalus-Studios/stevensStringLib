Welcome! StevensStringLib is a string library for the rest of us who just want working with strings in C++ to be easier.
We have lots of convenient functions for manipulating and processing strings. Check them out below!

# Simple installation and usage:
You can use this string library with the Beldum Package Manager:

## Install
Import "stevensStringLib.h" into your own project

or

### Beldum Package Manager: https://github.com/Nord-Tech-Systems-LLC/beldum_package_manager
```
mkdir new_project
cd new_project
beldum init
beldum install stevensStringLib
```

## Usage
`src/main.cpp`
```cpp

#include "stevensStringLib.h"

int main()
{
    stevensStringLib::containsOnly("111011112222", "12");
    return 0;
}


```



## Demo
#### Separate a string:
```
std::string myString = "Charmander,Squirtle,Bulbasaur";

std::vector<std::string> myVector = stevensStringLib::separate(myString, ',');

// myVector == {"Charmander, "Squirtle", "Bulbasaur"};
```

#### Remove all whitespace from a string:
```
std::string data = "   Flowers,\nRamona,  Toronto\r,Canada\t,212-664-7665    "

std::string cleanData = stevensStringLib::removeWhitespace(data);

// cleanData = "Flowers,Ramona,Toronto,Canada,212-664-7665"
```

#### Wrap a string to a certain width:
```
std::string textToWrap = "111222333";

std::string wrappedText = stevensStringLib::wrapToWidth(textToWrap, 3);

// wrappedText == "111\n222\n333\n";
```


## Requirements

To use the library: C++ 17 

If you'd like to build the test or benchmark files: CMake 3.22.1


## Easy Installation!

To get started, you can copy and paste the `stevensStringLib.h` file into your project's folder.

Then you should add an include statement at the top of the .cpp file you would like to use the library in. 
Make sure to NOT include the { } characters in your statement.

```
#include "{insert relative path from file to the library here}stevensStringLib.h"
```

For example, if `stevensStringLib.h` is in the same folder as your .cpp file, then it would look like this:

```
#include "stevensStringLib.h"
```

In your .cpp file you can give the library namespace a different name if you'd rather not keep typing `stevensStringLib`:

```
namespace strlib = stevensStringLib;
```

And then you're good to go!

```
std::vector<std::string> words = strlib::separate("Hello world!, ' ');
```



## Documentation

The documentation for this library is written to a series of offline webpages that can be viewed by clicking the "Open Documation" link in the `docs` folder. This documentation was generated by [Doxygen][4].

If you're viewing this README file as one of the Doxygen webpages, you can view the list of functions and all of their documentation by clicking here: stevensStringLib.h.

## Testing

stevensStringLib contains a suite of tests to validate its functionality within the `testing` folder. All testing is carried out with [Google Test][5].


To run these tests on your computer, you should use the cmake tool in the `testing` folder by running the command `cmake -S . -B ./build`.
This will generate an makefile to create an executable in the `testing/build` folder. Then, go to the `testing/build` folder and run the command `make`.
Once you have done this, you should have an executable named `test` in the `testing/build` folder which you can run the tests with.

## Benchmarking

stevensStringLib also contains benchmarking so you can see how fast and efficient its functions are in the `benchmarking` folder. All benchmarking is carried out with [Google Benchmark][6].


To run the benchmark on your computer, the process of creating the benchmark executable works very much the same way as the test executable: you should use the cmake tool in the `benchmarking` folder by running the command `cmake -S . -B ./build`.
This will generate a makefile to create an executable in the `benchmarking/build` folder. Then, go to the `benchmarking/build` folder and run the command `make`. Once you have done this, you should have an executable named `benchmark` in the `benchmarking/build` folder which you can run to benchmark the library.
