# stevensStringLib

Welcome to stevensStringLib! This is a simple C++ library that you include as a header file, construct the `stevensStringLib` object, and then you have the ability to use all of the library's useful functions.

More changes and updates to come soon! Just establishing the github page as of now. Feel free to make any changes and make pull requests!
