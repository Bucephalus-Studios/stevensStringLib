# stevensStringLib

Welcome to stevensStringLib! This is a simple C++ library full of useful functions for working with std::strings.

To get started, add the following to the top of your .cpp file:
`include "<insert path to the repo folder here>/stevensStringLib.h"`

Give the library namespace a short, catchy name:
`namespace strlib = stevensStringLib;`

And then you're good to go!
`std::vector<std::string> words = strlib::separate("Hello world!, " ");`

More changes and updates to come soon! Just establishing the github page as of now. Feel free to make any changes and make pull requests!
