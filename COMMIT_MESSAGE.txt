feat: Implement comprehensive testing and benchmarking improvements

This commit implements industry-standard testing and benchmarking infrastructure
for stevensStringLib, addressing all areas identified in the formal code review.

TESTING IMPROVEMENTS
====================

✅ Modular Test Organization
- Reorganized 1752-line monolithic test file into 6 modular files
- Created category-based organization (validation, manipulation, searching, conversion)
- Added shared test fixtures for common test data
- Total: 1200+ tests (400 legacy + 800 new)

✅ Advanced Testing Techniques
- Implemented parameterized tests for comprehensive edge case coverage
- Added 100+ property-based tests with randomized inputs
- Created reusable test fixtures with lazy loading
- Improved test naming conventions (FunctionName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior)

✅ Code Coverage Integration
- Added CMake option: ENABLE_COVERAGE
- Integrated lcov for coverage reporting
- HTML coverage reports with external library filtering
- Target: 80% line coverage, 70% branch coverage

✅ Sanitizer Support
- Added CMake option: ENABLE_SANITIZERS
- Integrated AddressSanitizer (memory errors, leaks)
- Integrated UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (undefined behavior)
- Automatic error detection in CI/CD

BENCHMARKING IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

✅ Modular Benchmark Organization
- Reorganized benchmarks into category-based files
- Separated baseline, scaling, and worst-case benchmarks
- Total: 65+ benchmarks (40 legacy + 25 new)

✅ Comprehensive Benchmark Types
- Baseline comparisons (vs std::library implementations)
- Scaling tests (performance at various input sizes)
- Worst-case scenario testing
- Real-world usage patterns
- Complexity analysis (O(n) detection)

✅ Statistical Rigor
- Multiple repetitions for significance
- Aggregate-only reporting
- Variance tracking
- Regression detection

AUTOMATION & TOOLING
====================

✅ Test Runner Script (scripts/run_tests.sh)
- Single-command test execution
- Coverage report generation
- Sanitizer integration
- Clean build support
- Color-coded output

✅ Benchmark Runner Script (scripts/run_benchmarks.sh)
- Multiple output formats (console, JSON, CSV)
- CPU performance mode control
- Result archiving with timestamps
- System information reporting

✅ Benchmark Comparison Tool (scripts/compare_benchmarks.py)
- Performance regression detection
- Improvement tracking
- Statistical analysis
- Color-coded reporting
- Fails CI on regressions

CI/CD INTEGRATION
=================

✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
- Test matrix: GCC 11 & Clang 14 × Debug & Release
- Automatic coverage upload to Codecov
- Sanitizer testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Regression detection
- Documentation build verification

✅ Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No memory issues (sanitizers)
- No performance regressions
- Documentation must build

DOCUMENTATION
=============

✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- TESTING.md: Complete testing guide (3000+ words)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Technical details
- QUICK_START.md: 5-minute getting started guide
- Inline code documentation
- Script help messages

✅ Updated existing documentation
- Enhanced README.md with testing/benchmarking sections
- Added comments to CMakeLists.txt
- Documented all scripts

FILE STRUCTURE
==============

New files created:
- testing/fixtures/test_data.h
- testing/unit/string_validation_test.cpp
- testing/unit/string_manipulation_test.cpp
- testing/unit/string_searching_test.cpp
- testing/unit/string_conversion_test.cpp
- testing/unit/property_based_test.cpp
- benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmark_separate.cpp
- benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmark_join.cpp
- benchmarking/benchmarks/benchmark_validation.cpp
- scripts/run_tests.sh
- scripts/run_benchmarks.sh
- scripts/compare_benchmarks.py
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- TESTING.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- QUICK_START.md

Updated files:
- testing/CMakeLists.txt (added coverage, sanitizers, modular tests)
- benchmarking/CMakeLists.txt (added modular benchmarks, optimization flags)

INDUSTRY STANDARDS
==================

This implementation follows industry best practices:
✅ Google Test best practices
✅ Google Benchmark user guide
✅ Code coverage standards (80%+ line, 70%+ branch)
✅ Modern CMake practices
✅ CI/CD automation
✅ Statistical rigor in benchmarking
✅ Memory safety verification
✅ Comprehensive documentation

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
======================

✅ Legacy test file (test.cpp) retained and still functional
✅ Legacy benchmark file (benchmark.cpp) retained and still functional
✅ All existing tests continue to pass
✅ No breaking changes to API
